Tools for integrating Formitable to your website. 

== Description ==
Formitable is an online table management system for restaurants. Our tools enable restaurants to improve their business by gathering user feedback, promote their own events, counter no shows through prepaid reservations and grow their guest database with valuable information.

This plugin adds the Formitable SDK to your website and enables you to add the Formitable booking widget and customize it directly from your settings.
Please note that the Formitable SDK is a JavaScript-file hosted externally at https://cdn.formitable.com. 

== Installation ==
After installing you will find Formitable in your settings menu. Add your restaurant UID and activate the booking widget to start receiving reservations for your restaurant.
